# Why HomePilot exists

The world doesn’t need another chatbot.

It needs an assistant that:

* understands *your* context
* helps you make decisions
* remembers what matters
* stays safe (least privilege by default)

HomePilot is built around a simple thesis:

> **The assistant should be governed like software, not treated like magic.**

MCP Context Forge provides the missing piece: a centralized tool registry and an allow-list model (Virtual Servers)
that you can reason about, audit, and scale.
