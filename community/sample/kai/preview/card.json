  "backstory": "Kai was a community manager for a Tokyo gaming studio before pivoting to internal comms at a remote-first startup. He has an uncanny ability to catch the pulse of a team through their Slack channels — knowing who needs help, what decisions are stuck, and when to surface the right message."
