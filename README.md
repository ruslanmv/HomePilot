**HomePilot** is an all-in-one, local-first GenAI application that unifies **chat, image generation, editing, video creation, and AI-powered storytelling** into a **single continuous conversation**. Designed to deliver a high-end experience, it remains entirely **self-hosted, auditable, and extensible**.

This repository contains the **"Home Edition"**: a production-oriented stack designed to run on a local machine (ideally with an NVIDIA GPU) using Docker Compose.

## 🎯 Project Aim

HomePilot aims to build a **single conversational GenAI system** where:

* **Unified Timeline:** Text, images, and video live in one chronological feed.
* **Multimodal:** Users can ask questions, generate art, edit assets, create stories, and animate video without context switching.
* **Natural Interaction:** Outputs appear naturally as part of the flow.
* **Privacy First:** Everything runs locally. Your data never leaves your machine.
* **Professional Creation:** Full-featured studio for content creators and enterprises.

This serves as the foundation for an "enterprise mind" capable of expanding into complex tool usage and automation.

```

### Data & Storage

* **Metadata:** Stored locally in SQLite.
* **Media:** Generated outputs are written to disk (`./outputs`).
* **Stories:** Project data and scenes stored in-memory (MVP) or SQLite.

* **Runtime:** Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin.
* **Dev:** Node.js 20+ (Only for local frontend development).

### GPU (Recommended)

* **Hardware:** NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (12GB+ recommended for FLUX models).
* **Drivers:** Latest NVIDIA drivers + NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
* *Note: If running without a GPU, disable GPU runtime settings in `docker-compose.yml`.*

### LLM Requirements

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruslanmv/homepilot
cd homepilot
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set ports, API keys, or paths
```

### 3. Download Models (Automated)

HomePilot provides automated model installation with three preset options:

```bash
# Recommended: FLUX Schnell + SDXL (~14GB)
make download-recommended

# Or choose a different preset:
# make download-minimal      # ~7GB - FLUX Schnell only
# make download-full         # ~65GB - All models including FLUX Dev, SD1.5, SVD
```

The script automatically:
- ✓ Checks if models exist before downloading
- ✓ Resumes interrupted downloads
- ✓ Retries failed downloads with exponential backoff
- ✓ Shows progress and summary statistics

For detailed installation options and manual installation, see [MODEL_INSTALLATION.md](MODEL_INSTALLATION.md)

**LLM Models** are managed separately via Ollama (auto-pulled when needed).

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
make install
make run
```

### 5. Access

* **UI:** `http://localhost:3000`
* **API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## ⚙️ Workflows (ComfyUI)

HomePilot is **workflow-driven**. Instead of hardcoded pipelines, it loads JSON workflows from `comfyui/workflows/`.

* **Flexibility:** To upgrade generation capabilities, simply update the JSON workflow file.
* **Process:** Backend injects prompts into the JSON → Submits to ComfyUI → Polls for results → Returns media URL.

### Available Workflows

- `flux_schnell.json` - Fast FLUX image generation
- `sdxl_base.json` - SDXL image generation
- `animate.json` - Image-to-video animation
- `edit.json` - Image editing with inpainting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Story outline generation fails**
- Ensure Ollama is running and accessible
- Check that at least one LLM model is available
- Verify the backend can connect to Ollama

**Images not generating**
- Verify ComfyUI is running (`http://localhost:8188`)
- Check that image models are downloaded
- Review backend logs for workflow errors

**TV Mode not working**
- Ensure at least one scene exists
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Logs

```bash
# View all logs
make logs

# View specific service
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f comfyui
