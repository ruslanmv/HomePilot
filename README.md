**HomePilot** is an all-in-one, local-first GenAI application that unifies **chat, image generation, editing, video creation, and AI-powered storytelling** into a **single continuous conversation**. Designed to deliver a high-end experience, it remains entirely **self-hosted, auditable, and extensible**.

This repository contains the **"Home Edition"**: a production-oriented stack designed to run on a local machine (ideally with an NVIDIA GPU) using Docker Compose.

## ✨ What's New

### 🎭 Personas — Persistent AI Identities
A **Persona** in HomePilot is not a chatbot, not a voice skin, and not a prompt template. It is a **persistent AI identity** — a named, visual, voice-enabled entity with its own personality, appearance, long-term memory, and session history that evolves with you over time. Where traditional assistants forget you between conversations, a Persona remembers. Where traditional UIs give you a text box, a Persona gives you a face, a voice, and a relationship. One identity, many sessions, continuous context — this is the foundation for AI that actually knows who it's talking to. See [docs/PERSONA.md](docs/PERSONA.md) for the full specification.

### 📦 Persona Portability — Share & Install Anywhere
Create a persona in Tokyo, share it with someone in Brazil, and they get the exact same identity — personality, tools, and all. HomePilot now packages personas into a portable **`.hpersona`** file that carries everything needed to reproduce the experience on any machine:
- **Export** any persona project as a single `.hpersona` package with one click
- **Import** by dragging the file into HomePilot — a 3-step preview shows the persona card, system prompt, and a dependency check (models, tools, MCP servers, A2A agents) before installing
- **Dependency awareness** — the package records which image models, personality tools, MCP servers, and A2A agents the persona relies on; the importer shows green/amber/red status for each so you know what's ready and what needs setup
- **Schema versioned** (v2) with backward compatibility — today's exports will still import correctly in future versions
- **Durable avatars** — persona images are committed into project-owned storage with top-crop face-anchored thumbnails, surviving host changes and container restarts

### 🌐 Community Gallery — Browse, Download, Install
A public persona registry where anyone can browse, download, and install community-created personas. HomePilot supports two gallery backends:
- **Browse** — search by name, filter by tag, content rating; see preview cards
- **One-click install** — download → preview (persona card + dependency check) → import, all without leaving the app
- **Backend proxy** — the frontend never calls external URLs; a caching proxy at `/community/*` keeps CORS clean and keys private
- **Cloudflare Worker** — production tier with R2 storage, immutable versioned assets, aggressive CDN caching
- **GitHub-native pipeline** — zero-infrastructure tier using GitHub Issues for submission, Actions for validation, Releases for storage, and Pages for the gallery
- **Submit a persona** — open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ruslanmv/HomePilot/issues/new?template=persona-submission.yml), attach your `.hpersona`, and a maintainer approves it with one label click
- **Automated publish** — once approved, the pipeline validates, creates a Release, updates `registry.json`, and deploys to [GitHub Pages](https://ruslanmv.github.io/HomePilot/gallery.html)
- See [docs/COMMUNITY_GALLERY.md](docs/COMMUNITY_GALLERY.md) for the full architecture and setup guide

### 🧠 Persona Memory — Adaptive & Basic Engines

Every persona has persistent memory that survives across sessions. Two engines let you choose the right behavior for each persona:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/memory-adaptive-vs-basic.svg" alt="Adaptive vs Basic Memory" width="820" /><br>
  <em>Adaptive Memory learns and forgets like a human brain. Basic Memory is deterministic and fully auditable.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/memory-hierarchy.svg" alt="Memory Hierarchy" width="720" /><br>
  <em>Adaptive Memory organizes knowledge into three tiers — Working (short-lived), Semantic (stable), and Pinned (permanent) — with exponential decay and reinforcement.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/memory-decay-reinforcement.svg" alt="Decay and Reinforcement" width="820" /><br>
  <em>Unused memories fade over time; accessed memories grow stronger. The system stays lean and relevant automatically.</em>
</p>

- **Adaptive Memory** — brain-inspired engine with decay, reinforcement, consolidation, and pruning; ideal for companion and assistant personas
- **Basic Memory** — deterministic flat store with TTL, per-category caps, near-duplicate detection, and pin-to-keep; ideal for secretary and enterprise personas
- Switch between engines at any time from Settings or during `.hpersona` import — no data loss

For the full technical deep dive (math, configuration, architecture), see **[docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md)**.

## 🎯 Project Aim

HomePilot aims to build a **single conversational GenAI system** where:

* **Unified Timeline:** Text, images, and video live in one chronological feed.
* **Multimodal:** Users can ask questions, generate art, edit assets, create stories, and animate video without context switching.
* **Natural Interaction:** Outputs appear naturally as part of the flow.
* **Privacy First:** Everything runs locally. Your data never leaves your machine.
* **Professional Creation:** Full-featured studio for content creators and enterprises.

This serves as the foundation for an "enterprise mind" capable of expanding into complex tool usage and automation.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruslanmv/homepilot
cd homepilot
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set ports, API keys, or paths
```

### 3. Download Models (Automated)

HomePilot provides automated model installation with three preset options:

```bash
# Recommended: FLUX Schnell + SDXL (~14GB)
make download-recommended

# Or choose a different preset:
# make download-minimal      # ~7GB - FLUX Schnell only
# make download-full         # ~65GB - All models including FLUX Dev, SD1.5, SVD
```

The script automatically:
- ✓ Checks if models exist before downloading
- ✓ Resumes interrupted downloads
- ✓ Retries failed downloads with exponential backoff
- ✓ Shows progress and summary statistics

For detailed installation options and manual installation, see [MODEL_INSTALLATION.md](MODEL_INSTALLATION.md)

**LLM Models** are managed separately via Ollama (auto-pulled when needed).

## 🔌 API Reference — 160+ Endpoints

HomePilot exposes **160+ REST endpoints** across core chat, media generation, personas, studio, agentic AI, and community gallery. Interactive Swagger docs are available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` after launch.

For the complete endpoint-by-endpoint reference, see **[API.md](API.md)**.

**Highlights:**

| Surface | Endpoints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core | `/chat`, `/health`, `/models`, `/upload` | Chat, health, model catalog |
| Personas | `/persona/*`, `/api/personalities` | 15 personalities, sessions, memory, `.hpersona` export/import |
| Studio | `/studio/*` (65+ routes) | Creator projects, scenes, outlines, export (PDF/PPTX/ZIP) |
| Enhancement | `/v1/enhance`, `/v1/upscale`, `/v1/background`, `/v1/outpaint` | Image editing pipeline |

| Community | `/community/*` | Gallery browse, download, install |
| Story | `/story/*` | Play Story mode, scene generation |

---

## ⚙️ Workflows (ComfyUI)

HomePilot is **workflow-driven**. Instead of hardcoded pipelines, it loads JSON workflows from `comfyui/workflows/`.

* **Flexibility:** To upgrade generation capabilities, simply update the JSON workflow file.
* **Process:** Backend injects prompts into the JSON → Submits to ComfyUI → Polls for results → Returns media URL.

### Available Workflows

- `flux_schnell.json` - Fast FLUX image generation
- `sdxl_base.json` - SDXL image generation
- `animate.json` - Image-to-video animation (LTX-Video)
- `wan_i2v.json` - Wan image-to-video

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Story outline generation fails**
- Ensure Ollama is running and accessible
- Check that at least one LLM model is available
- Verify the backend can connect to Ollama

**Images not generating**
- Verify ComfyUI is running (`http://localhost:8188`)
- Check that image models are downloaded
- Review backend logs for workflow errors

**TV Mode not working**
- Ensure at least one scene exists
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Logs
